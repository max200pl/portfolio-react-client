                                Hello! My name is Maksym. I'm a front-end developer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have a complete higher education in the technical direction.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have experience both in outsourcing companies and in one large product company Avanquest.
                            </p>
                            <p>I specialize in developing visual web and desktop applications.</p>
                            <p>
                                I use the React library to develop dynamic applications because I think itâ€™s the most convenient one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This technology also allowed to develop desktop application interfaces using the Sciter.js framework.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the future I want to become a Engineer developer.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My main goal is self-improvement and I see my professional growth in the IT industry.
                            </p>
